# LiDAR PDAL Experiments

<p>Those are my <strong><em>notes</em></strong> on taking some <strong>LiDAR</strong> data and testing different commands in PDAL. If you like, you can follow along using your own data.</p>

<p>Most probably I'll de adding or deleting stuff, but you can take a look to see some of the main operations that can be made on point clouds using <strong>PDAL</strong>.</p>

<p>This is an adaptation of the original workshop from the PDAL website, <a href="https://pdal.io/workshop/index.html">Point Cloud Processing and Analysis with PDAL</a>, the single difference being that I use the same data for every operation and show the commands output, too, while in the workshop there are used different data sources.</p>

<p>The workshop can be downloaded from <a href="https://pdal.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop/PDAL-workshop.pdf">here</a>, too.<br>The colored point cloud data that we will be using throughout this post can be viewed here: <a href="https://potree.entwine.io/data/view.html?r=&quot;https://maptheclouds.com/ept_yose_colored/&quot;">https://potree.entwine.io/data/view.html?r="https://maptheclouds.com/ept_dublin_colored/"</a>.</p>

This repo hosts the code examples.
